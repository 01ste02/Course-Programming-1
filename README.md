# Course-Programming-1
This is a repository containing all of my code exercises from the course Programming 1. It is a Swedish course from Polhemskolan in Lund, and is coded in c#. 

If anyone is interested in commented versions of the code, please email me at 01ste02@gmail.com and I will create one for you if I have the time.
